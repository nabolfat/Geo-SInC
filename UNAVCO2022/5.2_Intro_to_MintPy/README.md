# Intro to MintPy
2022 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Heresh Fattahi, Eric Fielding, Gareth Funning, Alex Lewandowski, Franz Meyer, Paul Rosen, Simran Sangha, Forrest William, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Niloufar Abolfathian, Becca Bussard, Brett Buzzanga, Emre Havazali

ISCE Version: v2.6

MintPy Version: v1.4.0

Resource: smallbaselineApp_aria.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Develop an understanding of the capabilities of MintPy, expected inputs and possible outputs, and control parameters

Assessment: Final project that brings together everything in previous lectures, including a time series analysis using MintPy, followed by an inversion of a specific model for one or two interferograms in the stack.  Could pick something like a dyke intrusion event, and analyze nearest pair and other pairs spanning the event and see how the models differ.
